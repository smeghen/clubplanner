## Club Planner

I decided to create an events planner site for a football club that I am involved with, to aid with the booking of the club facilities for training, meetings, matches
and other club activities. The idea being that this is a central location that users can access to view booked events, view upcoming events and see the availability of
the various facilities in this case Main Pitch, Training Pitch and the Club House.
When creating an event, users are booking the required facility based on its availability and for specific groups. 
An example would be Boys Under 10 Football training on Main pitch at a specific date and time, the application checks the database to see if there are any other
bookings for the selected facility on the date and time specified. In this this way there is not the possibility of double bookings is prevented. 

This site could be easily modified to other clubs, by modifying the styling of the site and creating a separate database which would be specific to the facilities of that club.

### User Experience (UX)

#### User Stories:
*As a Guest User:*
* I want to immediately understand the nature of the site and learn more about the organisation.
* I want to be able to easily navigate through the site, with the structure of the content easy to follow.
* I want to easily log in to the site
* I want to easily be able to register.
* I want to be able to create my profile and select the groups that are relevant to me.
* I want to be able to access the site from all device types.

*Registered User:*
* I want to be able to log onto the website and see the events that are relevant to me.
* I want to be able to edit my profile by adding/removing groups that I am a member of.
* I want to be easily able to log out of my account.
* I want to be able to schedule events based on the availability of the facilities.
* I want to be able to create events.
* I want to be able to edit events that I have created.
* I want to be able delete the events that I have created.
* I want to be able to contact the site owner with any questions I may have in regards to the website.


## Structure:
Home Page – Will have a photo of the Club with buttons to Login and Register. Below this will be the next events for each facility.

Log in Page – For Registered users provides fields for inputting Username and Password. Will also display link for users not already registered.

Register Page – For New users shows fields for Username and Password to register for the site. Once registered they will be directed to their Profile 
Page. Also, there will be a link for Users to login in case they have navigated to the wrong page.

Profile Page – When a User logs in the Events that they have created will be displayed, or if they do not have any Events created notifying that there is none. There will be links for Creating an event and Editing an event. 

Schedule Event Page – Create an event using Dropdown for Facility, Date and Time Picker. Will also assign the Event to specific Group. Availability will be checked to see if the required Time, Date and Facility have already been booked. 

Edit Event Page – Change a scheduled event by changing the specific fields. If a change to Facility, Date or Time is made, a check will take place to 
confirm the availability.

Delete Event Page – User will be asked if they are sure they want to delete an event. If they do then the event will be deleted and Facility, Date and 
Time will become available again.

Below is a Site diagram that I used as a basis for the structure of the project:

![Site Structure](static/images/Site-Structure.png "Site Structure Diagram")


## Design:

#### Colour scheme: 
The colour scheme for the site consists of very neutral colours that do not over power the content of the site. I choose to utilize the standard Materialize colour palette
of brown lighten-5 for the cards on the Home page and Profile Page. Also, I used lighened versions of Red, Blue and Green for buttons throughout the site.



#### Imagery:
The Calendar image is by Eric Rothermel I obtained from Unsplash and used for both the Home and Profile pages. The background images for Login, Register and Create Event Pages, are pictures of 
the club grounds which I took myself. The Training image Photo by Ambitious Creative Co. Rick Barrett, obtained from Unsplash is used on the Edit event page.
 

#### Database Schema:

Below is the database schema that I devised for the project:

![Database Schema](static/images/Database-Schema.png "Database Schema")


#### Wireframes:

Here is the wireframes that I used as the basis of the design
for the site. These were created using Balsamiq.

### Differences to Design

 * Home Page - I pretty much stuck to the my original design for the Home Page, I did change the Events being displayed to the next three events based on todays date. I also added an About Modal with 
 an explanation of the site, which is accessed from a button located on the parallax image. Finallly, I included a Search option below the displayed Events, so that users can search all the events 
 based on Facility, Name, Group Name and Description.

 * During the development process I decided to change the way of handling the User Profile based on the usability of the site and the added administration that would be required of a user for maintaining
 the Groups that they would be interested in. Based on this decision I totally removed the Edit Profile page from my design and consolidated the Profile page with the Edit/Delete Event Page. By doing this the Profile page now
 displays any events that a user has created, and within the card for each event is the option buttons to Edit or Delete the event. Also, added to the top of the page is a Create Event button. By making these changes I believe
 it makes it easier for users to navigate the site and control their Events.




### Features to be Implemented in Future

* Contact page with standard form for asking questions or passing on suggestions
* Administration Function for assisting with Users that forget passwords or usernames. 
* Administration Function that has the permission to Edit or Delete any events, so that assistance can be given to Users.

# Testing



#### Manual Testing



#### User Stories Testing




#### User Testing

Family members, peers of Slack and friends were asked to test the website and provide their thoughts on the user 
experience and any bugs that they found. Within this group of people the site was viewed on the following devices
 – Desktop, Laptop, iPad mini, iPad, iPhone 6, iPhone 8, Samsung Galaxy S6 and Huawei P30.

* Some feedback that I received was in relation to the Datepicker and the fact that you could book events in the past. This capability could cause potential issues if Users incorrectly enter dates, to
prevent this from happening I put a minDate: new Date() into the Datepicker JS function, which sets the minimum date available to select as today. In this way past dates are not available for selection.

* When a user is logged in buttons to Register and Login still appear on the Home page parallax image. By using {% if session.user %} was able to remove them from the page and with the {% else %} show all buttons to user not
logged in.



#### Validators

I used the W3 HTML Validation and got only 2 warning messages:

![HTML Validator Results](static/images/testing/HTML-Validator.PNG "HTML Validator Results")

These are warnings relating to heading elements in sections that are not relevant to the contain of the sections mentioned.

W3 CSS Validation was used to check the CSS used for the site:

![CSS Validator Results](static/images/testing/CSS-Validator.PNG "CSS Validator Results")

The error message relates to the Materialize cdn which is below my control.

I used Pep8 Online for checking my Pyhton code. When I first checked it I got the following:

![First PEP8 Results](static/images/testing/First-PEP8-Check.PNG "First PEP8 Results")

After going over the different issues highlighted I rechecked the code and got the below result:

![Revised PEP8 Results](static/images/testing/Revised-PEP8-Check.PNG "Revised PEP8 Results")

JSHint was used to validate the JavaScript and jQuery:

# Issues Encountered 

* Getting the Create Event function to check the database for existing Events that had the same parameters of Date, Time and Facility proved tricky for me. But, with a bit of time 
and Slack research I came to understand the concepts that were required. What was throwing me was how to put each of the parameters into the search of the database. Once I understood 
that declaring the variables of date, time and venue from the input form, and then passing them into the search of the database, it all fell into place for me. 

* At first I assumed that the Edit Event function would work the same way as the Create Event, in that it would check the database for existing events with the same parameters of date, time 
and facility, but upon testing I found that a user could not update the group, description or name of the event. The issue was that the Create Event search on the database when used in the Edit
Event was actually just finding itself when the date, time and facility had not been edited and returning an Already booked message. The way around this was to put in an extra parameter
of  "_id": { "$ne": ObjectId(event_id)}. So now the check on the database is for date, time, facility and event id not equal to the id that is being edited, then the event cannot be booked.

* To help highlight the text on the forms for creating and edit an event, I change the colour to white to stand out over the background images. This worked well for all inputs, however for the Datepicker the 
Month and Date where not visible as is a light coloured background. After a lot of research and trialing different solutions, I was able to resolve the issue with the use og Chrome Dev Tools, by selecting the items involved and finding the 
Materialize css classes that are controlling the colour and adding my own css styling to these classes.
